This page is a practice in JavaScript with web API's as the main focus for the project. There was no started code for this project. The goal was to create a quiz with a series of questions that are on a timer. As one goes through the questions if they are answered wrong time was to be reduced. This timer will start when the START button is clicked and then progressed through the questions with the NEXT button. At the end of the quiz the score is tallied up and the user then can put their initials in to record their score.
